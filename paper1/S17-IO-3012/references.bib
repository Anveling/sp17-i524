  abstract    = {Google Cloud Bigtable is a fully managed, high-performance, extremely scalable NoSQL database service offered through the
industry-standard, open-source Apache HBase API, powered by Bigtable. The Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) is a massive,
government-mandated database that will track every equities and options market event in the US financial industry over a
six-year period. We consider Google Cloud Bigtable in the context of CAT, and perform a series of experiments measuring the
speed and scalability of Cloud Bigtable. We find that Google Cloud Bigtable scales well and will be able to meet the requirements
of CAT. Additionally, we discuss how Google Cloud Bigtable fits into the larger full technology stack of the CAT platform.},
