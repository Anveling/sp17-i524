\begin{abstract}
This paper is an example research article for I524, written under the example template. 
We selected Techlist 363, Nagios, as the topic to demonstrate how to properly compose a research
article.
Nagios is a platform/tool, which provides a set of software for system and network infrastructure monitoring. Within this article, we explored what problem it tried to solve, how it solved the problem, and why it's important to have Nagios. We also discussed the advantages and disadvantages it possessed.

\section{Introduction}

According to ~\cite{nagios-book}, even through the machines have become more and 
more critical to us human being, they are untrustworthy. I just couldn't agree more with the author. Look at the GitLab.com incident happened on Jan 31st 2017. A tired system administrator, working late at night in the Netherlands, had accidentally deleted a directory on the wrong server during a frustrating database replication process: he wiped a folder containing 300GB of live production data that was due to be replicated~\cite{gitlabmeltdown}. Mistakes could be corrected easily since Gitlab have deployed several methods to backup and replicate the production data and all they just need to  do is to recover and restore from the backup. However, after several attempts, they found that out of 5 backup/replication techniques deployed none were working reliably or set up in the first place.


\section{What is Nagios}

Nagios is a system and network monitoring tool under open source license that provides instant awareness of mission-critical IT infrastructure. Nagios allows to monitor the infrastructure, alert the system admin, provide visualized reports, schedule downtime for maintenance, and plan upgrade in advance with trends and capacity diagrams. Its design emphasizes highly on flexibility and scalability. To provide such flexibility, Nagios is composed of different modules. The reason behind this modular design is that Nagios fully considers the variety of systems and networks it will monitor on. Different customers require a large amount of customization before they themselves know they do.



\section{Why is Nagios Important}

This section discusses why is Nagios important and why we need it.
Elaborate Nagios' features with Gitlab example in the introduction.
Modular. Scalable. Adaptable.

\label{sec:examples}

The sections below show examples of different article components.

\section{Advantages and Disadvantages}



It is not necessary to place figures and tables at the back of the
manuscript. Figures and tables should be sized as they are to appear
in the final article. Do not include a separate list of figure
captions and table titles.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard
way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

\subsection{Sample Figure}

Figure \ref{fig:false-color} shows an example figure.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/sample}}
\caption{False-color image, where each pixel is assigned to one of seven reference spectra.}
\label{fig:false-color}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sample Table}

Table \ref{tab:shape-functions} shows an example table.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{\bf Shape Functions for Quadratic Line Elements}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
local node & $\{N\}_m$ & $\{\Phi_i\}_m$ $(i=x,y,z)$ \\
\hline
$m = 1$ & $L_1(2L_1-1)$ & $\Phi_{i1}$ \\
$m = 2$ & $L_2(2L_2-1)$ & $\Phi_{i2}$ \\
$m = 3$ & $L_3=4L_1L_2$ & $\Phi_{i3}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \label{tab:shape-functions}
\end{table}

\section{Sample Equation}

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$
and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let

\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\label{eq:refname1}
\end{equation}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random
variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal
$\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. 

\section{Sample Algorithm}

Algorithms can be included using the commands as shown in algorithm
\ref{alg:euclid}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclid’s algorithm}\label{alg:euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
\State $r\gets a\bmod b$
\While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
\State $a\gets b$
\State $b\gets r$
\State $r\gets a\bmod b$
\EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
\State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Python example}\label{alg:python}
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left]
for i in range(0,100):
  print i
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Conclusion}



\section{Supplemental Material}

You can include an appendix with important information and additional
figures if needed. However they must be referenced and follow the same
guidelines as in the main text.  All materials must be associated with
a figure, table, or equation or be referenced in the results section
of the manuscript.  (1) 2D and 3D image files and video must be
labeled “Visualization,” not “Movie,” “Video,” “Figure,” etc.  (2)
Machine-readable data (for example, csv files) must be labeled “Data
File.”  Number data files and visualizations consecutively, e.g.,
“Visualization 1, Visualization 2….”  (3) Large datasets or code files
must be placed in github/gitlab.  Such items should be mentioned in
the text as either “Dataset” or “Code,” as appropriate, and also be
cited in the references list. Appropriate citations in jabref as Misc
need to be created.

\section{Possible technology paper outline}

The next sections are just some suggestions, your may want to add
sections and subsections as you see fit. Images and references do not
count towards the 2 page length. Please use the \verb|\section|,
\verb|\subsection|, and \verb|\subsubsection| commands in your
paper. do not introduce hardcoded numbers. Use the \verb|\ref| and
\verb|\label| commands to refer
 to the sections.


\paragraph{Abstract}

Put in the abstract a summary what this paper is about

\paragraph{1. Introduction}

Introduce the technology and provide general useful information.

\paragraph{2. Architecture} 

If applicable include a description about architectural details. This
may include a figure. Make sure that if you copy a figure you put the
\cite{?} in the caption also. Otherwise it is plagiarism.

\paragraph{2.1. API}

comment on the API which could include language bindings

\paragraph{2.2. Shell Access}

If applicable comment on how the tool can be used from the command line

\paragraph{2.3.Graphical Interface}

If applicable comment on if the technology has a GUI

\paragraph{3. Licensing}

Often tools may have different versions, some fre, some for
pay. Comment on this. For example while a tool may offer a comercial
version this version may be too costly for others. Identify especially
the difference between features for free vs commercial tools.

Sometimes you may need to introduce this also in the introduction as
there may be a big difference and without the knowledge you do not
provide the user an adequate introduction.

\paragraph{4. Ecosystem}

Some technologies have a large ecosystem developed around them with
extensions plugins and other useful tools. Identify if they exists and
comment on what they can achieve

provide potentially a mindmap or a figure illustrating how the
technology fits in with other technologies if applicable.

while focussing on big data related use cases. Make sure you do proper
references with the \cite{?} command. Do not put URLs in the text.

\paragraph {4.2. Other Use Cases}

Some technologies may not just be used for big data, find other makor
use cases from other areas if applicable.  Make sure you do proper
references with the \cite{?} command. Do not put URLs in the text.

\paragraph{5. Educational material}

Put information here how someone would find out more about the
technology. Use important material and do not list hundrets of web
