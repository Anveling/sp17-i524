\begin{abstract}
We are trying to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital, using several features representing patient and hospital outcomes. We will use Hadoop/Spark distributed architecture on multiple clouds as the core infrastructure and machine learning classification algorithms for data analysis.

\section{Introduction}

We will use Hadoop to split the dataset and transfer the data chunks to different data nodes. We will use Ansible to install pre-requisite softwares and push configurations on different machines. The data chunks would then be analyzed using machine learning techniques and the results would be aggregated predicting whether a patient would be readmitted or not. This information would help hospitals to be better prepared for readmitting patients.

\section{Deployment}
We will deploy a master $\&$ multiple slave nodes in the Hadoop/Spark distributed cluster environment. 

We will use \textbf{Ansible} as an automated application and configuration deployment tool. This will enable us to install softwares and push configurations simultaneously from master node to the respective target nodes. 

\section{Benchmarking}
We will assess the performance of the Hadoop/Spark clusters deployed on different clouds. The parameters for benchmarking would be memory usage, storage size and IO throughput.

    
    
\section{Results}
Results of data analysis and benchmarking will be showcased in this section.

\section{Conclusion}
Using the 130-US hospitals dataset \cite{www-dataset} for years 1999-2008, we should be able to analyze factors pertaining to readmission of patients with diabetes.
