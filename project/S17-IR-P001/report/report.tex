\begin{abstract}
This project involves development of a real-time system which streams live data from twitter to visualize the "Happiness index" across the English-speaking regions in the world. Live data from twitter is injected into the system using streaming API in spark. All possible tweets are taken into consideration for analyzing the overall happiness level of people tweeting from different locations. Suitable classifier will be built to identify if the tweet is positively biased. The results of the Language processing algorithm will be visualized in  real-time using d3.js.

\section{Introduction}
In 1969, Drs. Jerry Boucher and Charles E. Osgood, psychologists at the University of Illinois, proposed the 'Pollyanna Hypothesis' which asserts that "there is a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating" \cite{BOUCHER19691}. Such theories were hard to validate due to the absence of significant data and the lack of generality. With Social media turning into the primary platform where people express on a day-to-day basis these claims can be analysed by sampling a portion of the data. Twitter generates nearly 200,000 tweets in less than a minute. Big data technologies prove to be particularly useful in in storing, processing and analysing such large data. It is also possible to setup real-time systems that can output results with a latency of very few seconds. 

\section{Execution Summary}
The approximate schedule for completion of this project has been outlines in the section below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {Mar 6 - Mar 12, 2017} Create virtual machines on Chameleon, FutureSystems and Jetstream clouds using Cloudmesh and submit the project proposal.
\item {Mar 13-Mar 19, 2017} Deploy Hadoop cluster to the clouds using Cloudmesh and create Ansible playbook to install the required software packages (Cassandra,D3.js,Kafka etc.) to the clusters  and to upload the twitter data.
\item {Mar 20-Mar 26, 2017} Pre-processing of the tweets to create required features for using in the Natural Language Processing algorithm. Building a language model to estimate the Happiness quotient
\item {Mar 27-Apr 02, 2017} Develop an interactive visualization of the analysed data in D3.js
\item {Apr 03-Apr 09, 2017} Continuing with the D3.Js visualization and connecting with streaming data from twitter to convert it into a live dashboard.
\item {Apr 10 - Apr 16, 2017} Create software package that can be readily deployed in Python
\item {Apr 17-Apr 23, 2017} Complete the partially done  Project Report
\end{enumerate}

\section{Workflow}
The project will make use of the following four components. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apache Spark
    \item Apache Kafka
    \item Apache Cassandra
    \item D3.js
\end{enumerate}

The Architecture of the system is shown in Fig.1

\subsection{Phase 1: Streaming Twitter data using Apache Spark}
Spark is a high speed in-memory data engine which is specialized to perform tasks such as streaming or requiring repeated access to datasets. The objective is to obtain the happiness index of tweets from different English speaking countries around the world. Thus it will require a fairly large amount of tweets collected over a time frame(TBD). Spark's framework provides the facility to work with a variety of data formats including text. Spark streaming which is the extension of the core spark API aids in the streaming process and delivers it to the core engine. The data is then passed to Apache Kafka which helps in pipeline processing
\subsection{Phase 2: Kafka}
Kafka, a queueing system serves as an ingestion backbone to Apache spark. It is a super-fast, low-latency, distributed and partitioned stream processing service. Kafka being highly reliable and scalable, is perfect for integrating the huge stream of twitter data to a data sink. 

\subsection{Phase 3: Apache Cassandra}
Cassandra was chosen as the database because of it's high scalability and reliability. Cassandra used along with spark streaming and kafka forms an excellent base for real time analytics. Cassandra being a NoSQL database is well suited to store unstructured textual data. A feature that makes Cassandra stand out is that it is a column oriented database which makes it horizontally scalable too. 

\subsection{Phase 4: D3.js}

Real time visualization of the processed data streamed from Kafka message queuing service would be created to view the results from the analytics performed on the twitter data.
