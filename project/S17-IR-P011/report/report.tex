By deploying our face detection application on Docker cluster, we will
try to achieve high throughput by parellalizing processing of images
for head count task on multiple nodes each having thousand of
pictures.

\section{Introduction}

Counting the number of people in a image has been a challenge in the
field of computer vision \cite{www-face-detection-wikipedia}. Given a
huge number of images, finding the number of people in each image can
become a cumbersome task. We try to solve this issue using our
distributed approach using a docker swarm cluster which is a cluster
of Docker \cite{www-docker-wikipedia} engines, or nodes, where
services have to be deployed. We run the OpenCV
\cite{www-opencv-wikipedia} face detection algorithms on smaller data
in multiple nodes and obtain the head count of the people in each
picture.
